This folder contains examples for using the Csound API in Rust. They start with a minimal usage of Csound and each example afterwards builds upon the previous one.
## Useful Notes

* It is assumed that you have installed Cargo.
For instructions about How install rust and tools, check the documentation for [How to install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* To run an example, in a terminal, go to each example directory.
```
$ cd rust/example5
$ cargo build --release
$ cargo run
```
This will build/run the example 5.
